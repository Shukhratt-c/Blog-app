# Blogging App

This project is a blogging app that allows users to create and view blog posts. It is built using Next.js for the front-end, Prism.js for code highlighting, Tailwind CSS for styling, GraphQL for the server, and Hyphgraph CMS as the headless CMS. The project also uses simple-icons, react-paginate, and nodemailer as minor packages.

The main purpose of this project is to practice using these technologies and to gain a deeper understanding of how they work together.
